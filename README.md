# Locker-Puzzle

It is a puzzle based on locker. 

A school has nLock lockers and nStud Students. All lockers are closed on the first day of school. As the students enter, the first student, opens every locker.
Then the second student, begins with the second locker, and closes every other locker. Student 3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed) and so on, until student last student changes last locker.
